| Regular in-person or online meetings, professional briefings, discussions, and exchanges of views are very important to me. Their absence contributed to my voluntary job change.                               | 4.00     |
| In my previous organization, live or online communication was regular (e.g., daily/weekly team meetings, conferences, discussions with direct superiors).	                                                         | 4.00     |
| It is very important for me to be able to share my new ideas and suggestions with my superiors and colleagues. The fact that I could not do this contributed to my voluntary job change.	                        | 4.00     |
| My previous workplace encouraged everyone to share their ideas with a series of measures (e.g., brainstorming sessions, suggestion boxes).	                                                                     | 4.00     |
| The free expression of negative feedback is a fundamental expectation for me. The fact that I could not express my negative feedback contributed to my voluntary job change.	                            | 2.00     |
| My previous employer encouraged everyone to freely express their dissatisfaction (e.g., there was a "complaint" box).	                                                                                             | 4.00     |
| I expect my superiors and colleagues to acknowledge good performance (also) verbally. The fact that I did not receive appreciative feedback for my good performance contributed to my voluntary job change. | 4.00     |
